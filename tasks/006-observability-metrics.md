# Task 006: Observability and Metrics

## Description

Implement distributed tracing, metrics collection, and structured logging for comprehensive system observability.

## Objectives

- Implement correlation IDs for distributed tracing
- Create metrics endpoint exposing system performance data
- Set up structured logging with proper format
- Configure PCI-compliant logging for sensitive data
- Implement end-to-end tracing of payment flows

## Acceptance Criteria

- Correlation IDs are present in every request and response
- Metrics endpoint exposes required performance indicators
- Logs use structured format and capture all required information
- End-to-end tracing of payment flows is verifiable through logs
- No sensitive data appears in logs according to PCI DSS
- Unit tests with at least 80% coverage for observability components

## Dependencies

- Task 001: Project Setup
- Task 002: Core Payment Flows Implementation

## Estimated Effort

- 1-2 days

## Status

- [ ] Not Started
