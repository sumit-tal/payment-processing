# Task 002: Core Payment Flows Implementation

## Description

Implement the core payment flows by integrating with the Authorize.Net Sandbox API, focusing on the purchase and authorization modules.

## Objectives

- Implement Purchase (Auth + Capture in One Step) module
- Implement Authorization + Capture (Two-Step) module
- Implement Cancel (Before Capture) functionality
- Implement Refund (Full + Partial) module
- Set up database entities for transactions
- Implement idempotency and retry mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria

- All core payment flows function correctly in the sandbox environment
- Idempotent request handling is implemented
- Database entities properly store transaction states
- API endpoints for each flow are properly documented
- Unit tests with at least 80% coverage for implemented modules

## Dependencies

- Task 001: Project Setup

## Estimated Effort

- 3-4 days

## Status

- [x] Completed

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented all core payment flows with industry-standard practices:

### ‚úÖ Completed Features
- **Purchase Flow**: Single-step auth+capture transactions
- **Authorization Flow**: Two-step authorization with delayed capture
- **Capture Flow**: Full and partial capture of authorized payments
- **Refund Flow**: Full and partial refunds with proper validation
- **Cancel/Void Flow**: Cancellation of authorized transactions
- **Idempotency**: Robust duplicate prevention using idempotency keys
- **Database Integration**: ACID-compliant transaction handling
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios with proper HTTP codes
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict typing
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for all flows
- **Database Migration**: Production-ready database schema

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture
- **Entities**: `Transaction` and `PaymentMethod` with proper indexing
- **Services**: `PaymentService` (orchestration) and `AuthorizeNetService` (gateway)
- **Controllers**: RESTful API with proper validation and documentation
- **DTOs**: Strongly-typed request/response objects with validation

### üîí Security & Reliability
- Credit card data not persisted in database
- Database transactions for data consistency
- Comprehensive logging and audit trails
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper error handling without information leakage

### üìä API Endpoints
- `POST /payments/purchase` - Create purchase transaction
- `POST /payments/authorize` - Create authorization
- `POST /payments/capture` - Capture authorized payment
- `POST /payments/refund` - Process refunds
- `POST /payments/cancel` - Cancel/void transactions
- `GET /payments/:id` - Retrieve transaction details

### üß™ Testing
- Unit tests for all services and controllers
- Mock implementations for external dependencies
- Error scenario coverage
- Idempotency validation tests

All acceptance criteria have been met and the implementation follows industry best practices for payment processing systems.
