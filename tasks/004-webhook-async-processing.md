# Task 004: Webhook and Asynchronous Processing

## Description

Implement webhook handling and asynchronous processing infrastructure using AWS SQS for payment events.

## Objectives

- Develop webhook handlers for Authorize.Net events
- Set up AWS SQS integration for queue-based event handling
- Implement workers for processing queued events
- Configure dead-letter queues for failed processing
- Implement idempotency for webhook event processing
- Develop error handling and retry strategies

## Acceptance Criteria

- Webhook endpoints correctly receive and validate Authorize.Net events
- Events are properly queued in AWS SQS
- Worker processes handle events asynchronously
- Failed events are properly handled with dead-letter queues
- Duplicate webhook events are properly identified and handled
- System maintains data consistency during async processing
- Unit tests with at least 80% coverage for webhook handling

## Dependencies

- Task 001: Project Setup
- Task 002: Core Payment Flows Implementation

## Estimated Effort
