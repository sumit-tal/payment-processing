# Payment Processing System Technical PRD

## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: NestJS with TypeScript
- **Architecture Pattern**: Monolithic
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **API Design**: RESTful
- **Queue System**: AWS SQS
- **Version Control**: Git

### 1.2 Architecture Overview

The payment processing system will be implemented as a monolithic NestJS application that directly integrates with the Authorize.Net Sandbox API. The system will handle various payment flows, process webhooks asynchronously, and maintain persistent storage of transaction data in PostgreSQL.

### 1.3 Module Structure

The system will be organized by payment flows rather than technical concerns:

- **Purchase Module**: Handles Auth + Capture in one step
- **Authorization Module**: Manages two-step Auth + Capture process
- **Cancellation Module**: Processes transaction voids before capture
- **Refund Module**: Handles full and partial refunds
- **Subscription Module**: Manages recurring billing
- **Webhook Module**: Processes async payment events
- **Common Module**: Shared services, utilities, and middleware

## 2. Authorize.Net Integration

### 2.1 API Integration

- Direct integration with Authorize.Net Sandbox API using official documentation
- No third-party wrappers permitted
- Use official SDKs if available for Node.js/TypeScript

### 2.2 Payment Flows

1. **Purchase (Auth + Capture in One Step)**

   - Implement using appropriate Authorize.Net endpoint per documentation
   - Single-step transaction with immediate capture

2. **Authorize + Capture (Two-Step)**

   - Implement auth and capture as separate API calls
   - Maintain transaction state between calls

3. **Cancel (Before Capture)**

   - Void authorized transactions that haven't been captured
   - Handle edge cases for timing conflicts

4. **Refunds (Full + Partial)**

   - Support both full refund functionality
   - Implement partial refund with amount validation

5. **Subscriptions / Recurring Billing**
   - Create and manage subscription plans
   - Handle recurring payment schedules
   - Process subscription lifecycle events

### 2.3 Retry Strategy

- Maximum retry attempts: 3
- Implement exponential backoff
- Initial timeout period: 5 seconds
- No differentiation based on error codes

## 3. Data Management

### 3.1 Database Design

- PostgreSQL database with TypeORM
- Entity-relationship model for payment entities
- Use TypeORM migrations for database schema changes

### 3.2 Key Entities

- Transactions
- Payment Methods (tokenized)
- Customers
- Subscriptions
- Webhook Events
- Audit Logs

### 3.3 Data Consistency

- Use database transactions for multi-step operations
- Implement idempotency with transaction IDs
- Maintain transaction state transitions

## 4. Security Implementation

### 4.1 Authentication & Authorization

- API Key authentication for clients
- API keys stored in environment variables
- 30-day rotation policy for API keys
- Rate limiting per API key

### 4.2 PCI DSS Compliance (SAQ A)

- Use Authorize.Net's tokenization services
- Special handling for sensitive data:
  - Card number
  - Expiration date
  - CVV
- No storage of sensitive cardholder data
- Encryption for data both at rest and in transit

### 4.3 Secure Configuration

- Environment-based configuration management
- Secrets stored in environment variables
- Clear separation of environments (Dev, UAT, Prod)

## 5. Asynchronous Processing

### 5.1 Webhook Handling

- Process the following webhook events:
  - Successful transactions
  - Failed transactions
  - Refunds
  - Chargebacks
  - Subscription creation
  - Subscription renewal
  - Subscription cancellation
- Push incoming webhook payloads to SQS queue

### 5.2 Queue Management

- AWS SQS for queue-based event handling
- Failed queue processing handled by separate worker
- 7-day retention policy for processed messages
- Implement dead-letter queue for failed processing
- No specific business logic triggered by webhook events

## 6. Observability & Monitoring

### 6.1 Distributed Tracing

- Correlation IDs in every request and response
- End-to-end tracing of payment flows through logs

### 6.2 Metrics Endpoint

Expose the following metrics:

- Transaction success/failure rates
- API response times
- Queue length/processing times
- Error rates by type

### 6.3 Logging

- Structured logging format
- Log all payment-related activities for audit purposes
- PCI-compliant handling of sensitive data in logs

## 7. Code Quality & Testing

### 7.1 TypeScript Patterns & Practices

- Repository pattern for database access
- Class-validator for DTO validation
- Custom error classes with HTTP status codes
- TypeORM for database operations

### 7.2 Testing Requirements

- Unit testing with at least 80% code coverage
- Test framework to be determined based on NestJS best practices

### 7.3 Code Style

- Follow NestJS and TypeScript best practices
- Consistent naming conventions
- Documentation comments for public APIs

## 8. System Requirements & Constraints

### 8.1 Performance

- Handle high volumes of transactions efficiently
- No specific response time requirements for synchronous operations

### 8.2 Scalability

- Designed for eventual horizontal scaling
- Queue-based architecture for asynchronous processing

## 9. Implementation Approach

### 9.1 Development Phases

1. Core payment flows implementation
2. Webhook and asynchronous processing
3. Security and compliance implementation
4. Observability and metrics

### 9.2 Development Environment

- Local development with Docker
- No specific CI/CD requirements

### 9.3 Documentation

- API documentation required
- Implementation details documented in code
- PCI DSS compliance documentation

## 10. Success Criteria

- All core payment flows function correctly in sandbox
- System achieves >80% unit test coverage
- End-to-end tracing verifiable through logs
- Webhook events processed asynchronously without data loss
- Compliance with all specified requirements
