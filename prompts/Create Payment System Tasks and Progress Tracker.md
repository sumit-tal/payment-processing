### User Input

@[business.prd.md] @[technical.prd.md] 
create a tasks folder in the current directory. Create a high level tasks. Each tasks file name should start with numbers 001, 002 ...

Also create a progess.md to track the status of task

### Planner Response

I'll help you create a tasks folder structure and progress tracking file. First, let's look at the PRD documents to understand the project better so we can create appropriate task files.

Let me examine the business and technical PRD documents:

*Viewed [business.prd.md](file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/business.prd.md) *

*Viewed [technical.prd.md](file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/technical.prd.md) *

### Planner Response

I'll create a structured tasks folder and progress tracking file for the payment processing system project. Based on the PRD documents, I'll organize the tasks according to the implementation phases and module structure.

First, let's create a plan for this work:

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

Now I'll create the necessary task files and progress tracking file. Let me first check if the tasks directory already exists:

*Searched filesystem*

### Planner Response

Now I'll create the tasks directory and then create the task files:

*Proposed code*

### Planner Response

Let me continue creating the task files for the payment processing system. Next, I'll create a task file for core payment flows:

*Proposed code*

### Planner Response

Let me continue creating the next task files:

*Proposed code*

### Planner Response

Let me continue creating the task files for the webhook/async processing:

*Proposed code*

*Proposed code*

### Planner Response

Let's continue creating the remaining task file for observability and metrics:

*Proposed code*

### Planner Response

Now, let me create the progress.md file to track the status of all tasks:

*Proposed code*

*Updated todo list*

## Task Structure Created Successfully

I've created the following items for your payment processing system project:

1. **Tasks folder with numbered task files**:
   - `001-project-setup.md` - Initial project configuration and environment setup
   - `002-core-payment-flows.md` - Core payment processing functionality
   - `003-subscription-module.md` - Subscription and recurring billing features
   - `004-webhook-async-processing.md` - Async event handling with AWS SQS
   - `005-security-compliance.md` - Security features and PCI DSS compliance
   - `006-observability-metrics.md` - Distributed tracing and metrics collection

2. **Progress tracking file (`progress.md`)** with:
   - Task status overview table
   - Detailed progress tracking for each task
   - Weekly status update section
   - Notes and decisions section for important project decisions

Each task file follows a consistent structure with description, objectives, acceptance criteria, dependencies, estimated effort, and status tracking. The tasks are organized according to the implementation phases mentioned in the technical PRD, starting with project setup and progressing through core functionality, subscription handling, asynchronous processing, security, and observability.

You can now start tracking progress on these tasks by updating the status in both the individual task files and the central progress.md file.
