1. Are there specific webhook events we need to handle from Authorize.Net?
   - Which specific payment events should trigger notifications? (e.g., successful transactions, failed transactions, refunds, chargebacks)
   - Do we need to handle subscription-related webhook events (subscription creation, renewal, cancellation)?
   - Should certain webhook events trigger specific business logic in our system?

## PCI DSS Implementation

2. What specific PCI DSS requirements are most critical for our implementation?

# Payment Processing System Architecture Summary

Thank you for providing detailed answers to all technical questions. Based on your responses, I now have a complete understanding of the requirements for the payment processing system. Here's a summary of the key architectural decisions:

## Core Architecture
- **Technology Stack**: NestJS with TypeScript
- **Architecture Style**: Monolithic
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TypeORM and migrations
- **API Design**: RESTful

## Payment Flow Implementation
- Payment modules organized by flow (purchase, authorize+capture, cancel, refunds, subscriptions)
- Repository pattern for database access
- Class-validator for DTO validation
- Custom error classes with HTTP status codes
- Database transactions for multi-step operations

## Integration Strategy
- Direct integration with Authorize.Net Sandbox API using official documentation
- Retry strategy: 3 attempts with exponential backoff, 5-second initial timeout
- Tokenization using Authorize.Net's services for PCI DSS compliance (SAQ A scope)

## Asynchronous Processing
- AWS SQS for queue-based event handling
- Separate worker for failed queue processing
- 7-day retention policy with dead-letter queue implementation
- Processing webhooks for: successful/failed transactions, refunds, chargebacks, subscription events

## Security Implementation
- API key authentication with 30-day rotation policy
- Rate limiting per API key
- Special handling for sensitive data (card number, expiration date, CVV)
- Encryption both at rest and in transit

## Observability
- Correlation IDs for distributed tracing
- Metrics endpoint exposing: transaction success/failure rates, API response times, queue metrics, error rates

Would you like me to:
1. Create a high-level architectural diagram for this system?
2. Provide a recommended folder/module structure for the NestJS implementation?
3. Outline specific strategies for implementing any of these components?

### Planner Response

I've created a comprehensive technical PRD file (`technical.prd.md`) in your project folder based on all the requirements we discussed. The document provides detailed specifications for implementing the payment processing system with NestJS and TypeScript.

The technical PRD includes:

1. Complete system architecture with NestJS modules organized by payment flows
2. Detailed Authorize.Net integration specifications and retry strategies
3. Database design with PostgreSQL and TypeORM
4. Security implementation including PCI DSS compliance (SAQ A)
5. Asynchronous processing with SQS and webhook handling
6. Observability and monitoring requirements
7. Code quality standards and testing requirements
8. Implementation approach and success criteria

Is there anything specific in the technical PRD you'd like me to elaborate on or modify?
