## Task 004: Webhook and Asynchronous Processing - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

I have successfully implemented Task 004: Webhook and Asynchronous Processing following industry standards. Here's a comprehensive summary of what was delivered:

### üéØ **Core Implementation**

**AWS SQS Integration:**
- Complete SQS service with message queuing, batch processing, and queue statistics
- Exponential backoff retry mechanism with configurable delays
- Dead letter queue handling for failed events

**Webhook Processing:**
- Authorize.Net webhook endpoint with comprehensive validation
- HMAC-SHA512 signature verification for security
- Payload structure validation and timestamp checking
- Support for all major webhook event types (payments, subscriptions)

**Asynchronous Processing:**
- Worker service for processing events from SQS queue
- Concurrent message processing with configurable limits
- Intelligent retry logic with permanent failure detection

**Idempotency Mechanisms:**
- Multi-layer approach using external IDs and content hashing
- In-memory cache with TTL for fast duplicate detection
- Database constraints to ensure unique event processing

### üèóÔ∏è **Technical Architecture**

**Services Created:**
- [WebhookService](cci:2://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/modules/webhooks/services/webhook.service.ts:9:0-325:1) - Core webhook orchestration
- [WebhookValidationService](cci:2://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/modules/webhooks/services/webhook-validation.service.ts:9:0-261:1) - Security and validation
- [SqsService](cci:2://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/modules/webhooks/services/sqs.service.ts:29:0-344:1) - AWS SQS queue management
- [WebhookWorkerService](cci:2://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/modules/webhooks/services/webhook-worker.service.ts:6:0-479:1) - Async event processing
- [DeadLetterQueueService](cci:2://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/modules/webhooks/services/dead-letter-queue.service.ts:20:0-451:1) - Failed event handling
- [IdempotencyService](cci:2://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/modules/webhooks/services/idempotency.service.ts:17:0-367:1) - Duplicate prevention

**Database Schema:**
- [WebhookEvent](cci:2://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/modules/webhooks/entities/webhook-event.entity.ts:32:0-154:1) entity with proper indexing
- Migration with unique constraints for idempotency
- Status tracking and audit trail support

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /webhooks/authorize-net` - Receive webhooks
- `GET /webhooks/events` - List events with filtering
- `GET /webhooks/events/:id` - Get event details
- `POST /webhooks/events/:id/retry` - Manual retry
- `GET /webhooks/stats` - Processing statistics
- `GET /webhooks/health` - Health check

### üîí **Industry Standards Compliance**

‚úÖ **Security:** HMAC signature validation, replay attack prevention  
‚úÖ **Reliability:** Exponential backoff, dead letter queues  
‚úÖ **Idempotency:** Multi-layer duplicate detection  
‚úÖ **Observability:** Comprehensive logging and monitoring  
‚úÖ **Testing:** Unit tests with 80%+ coverage target  
‚úÖ **Documentation:** OpenAPI/Swagger integration  

### üìä **Configuration Added**

Updated [.env.example](cci:7://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/.env.example:0:0-0:0) with:
- AWS SQS configuration (region, credentials, queue URLs)
- Webhook security settings (secret keys, timeouts)
- Processing parameters (retry limits, visibility timeouts)

### üß™ **Testing**

Created comprehensive unit tests for:
- Webhook validation service
- Core webhook processing logic
- Idempotency mechanisms
- Error handling scenarios

The implementation is **production-ready** and follows all the acceptance criteria from the task requirements. The system can now handle Authorize.Net webhooks reliably with proper error handling, retry mechanisms, and monitoring capabilities.

**Next Priority:** Task 005 - Security and Compliance Implementation
