### Planner Response

I've created comprehensive unit tests for the PaymentMethodService. The test file follows the existing test patterns and covers all the service's methods with both positive and negative scenarios.

Here's what the tests include:

1. **createPaymentMethod tests**:
   - Happy path: Successfully creating a payment method
   - Setting a new payment method as default
   - Error handling when the Authorize.Net API fails

2. **getPaymentMethodById tests**:
   - Successfully retrieving a payment method
   - Handling not found scenarios

3. **getPaymentMethodsByCustomer tests**:
   - Retrieving all active payment methods for a customer
   - Handling empty results

4. **updatePaymentMethod tests**:
   - Successfully updating a payment method
   - Setting a payment method as default
   - Handling not found scenarios

5. **deletePaymentMethod tests**:
   - Successfully soft-deleting a payment method
   - Preventing deletion of default payment methods
   - Handling not found scenarios

6. **detectCardBrand tests**:
   - Correctly identifying different card brands (Visa, Mastercard, etc.)
   - Handling unknown or empty card numbers

The tests follow best practices including:
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Clear test descriptions
- Comprehensive mocking of dependencies
- Testing edge cases and error conditions
- Proper isolation between tests

You can run these tests using the Jest test runner to verify the functionality of the PaymentMethodService.

@[TerminalName: jest, ProcessId: 81712] my test cases are breaking help me to fix this

### Planner Response

I see the issue with your test cases. The tests for the [detectCardBrand](cci:1://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/modules/payments/services/payment-method.service.ts:63:2-78:3) method are failing because we're mocking the entire method to always return "Visa" regardless of the input. Let's fix this by removing the mock for the [detectCardBrand](cci:1://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/modules/payments/services/payment-method.service.ts:63:2-78:3) method and letting the actual implementation run.

### Planner Response

Looking at the test failures, I can see that all the [detectCardBrand](cci:1://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/modules/payments/services/payment-method.service.ts:63:2-78:3) tests are failing because we're mocking the method to always return "Visa". Let's fix this by removing that mock and letting the actual implementation run.

### Planner Response

Great! All the tests are now passing successfully. Let me explain what was fixed:

1. **Removed the mock for detectCardBrand method**: 
   The main issue was that we were mocking the [detectCardBrand](cci:1://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/modules/payments/services/payment-method.service.ts:63:2-78:3) method to always return "Visa", which caused all the card brand detection tests to fail. By removing this mock, we allowed the actual implementation to run, which correctly identifies different card types based on their numbers.

2. **Fixed import path**:
   We corrected the import path for the PaymentMethod entity by changing from the alias `@/database/entities/payment-method.entity` to the relative path `../../../../database/entities/payment-method.entity`.

The test output confirms that all 21 tests are now passing, including the previously failing card brand detection tests. The error message you see in the output is actually expected and part of the test that verifies error handling when the Authorize.Net API fails.

Your unit tests now correctly verify:
- All the main service methods (create, get, update, delete)
- Both success and error scenarios
- The card brand detection logic for different card types
- Edge cases like empty card numbers
