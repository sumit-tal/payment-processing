7. Make tests self-contained, readable, and maintainable.
8. Use clear and descriptive test names.


### Planner Response

I'll write unit tests for the webhook services. Let's first examine each service to understand their functionality and then create appropriate test cases.

Let me start by looking at the files:

*Viewed [dead-letter-queue.service.ts](file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/modules/webhooks/services/dead-letter-queue.service.ts) *

### Planner Response

Let me continue examining the other files to understand their functionality:

### Planner Response

I'll write unit tests for the webhook services. Based on my analysis of the files and the existing test structure, I'll create comprehensive tests for each service.

Let me start by creating a todo list for this task:

### Planner Response

I see there are some test failures in the unit tests we created. Let's fix these issues to ensure all tests pass correctly.

Looking at the test output, we have 2 failed test suites and 32 failed tests. The main issues appear to be related to the SQS service tests and some mocking issues. Let me fix these problems:
