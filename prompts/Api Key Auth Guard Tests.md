### User Input

You are a senior software engineer. Write unit test cases for the following @[src/common/guards/api-key-auth.guard.ts] 

Requirements:
1. Follow existing written test cases.
2. write tests in __test__ folder
3. Cover positive scenarios (happy path).
4. Cover negative scenarios (invalid inputs, error conditions).
5. Include boundary/edge cases.
6. Use best practices for [framework] (e.g., Arrange-Act-Assert).
7. Make tests self-contained, readable, and maintainable.
8. Use clear and descriptive test names.


### Planner Response

To write accurate and comprehensive tests, I need to inspect the guard implementation at `src/common/guards/api-key-auth.guard.ts` to understand its behavior, dependencies, and edge cases. I will open this file now.

*Viewed [api-key-auth.guard.ts](file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/common/guards/api-key-auth.guard.ts) *

### Planner Response

I'll inspect the existing test setup and any patterns used in this repository to ensure the new tests follow the established conventions and structure. I'll list the test directory and search for similar guard tests or general Jest configuration.

*Listed directory [test](file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/test) *

### Planner Response

I'll search the repository for existing unit test patterns (file names, configuration, and any mocks) to ensure the new tests follow the project's conventions, then create the guard tests under a __test__ folder.

*Grep searched codebase*

### Planner Response

I'll open the Jest configuration to understand how tests are discovered and any setup that's required, and I'll also peek at a couple of existing spec files to follow their style and mocking patterns.

*Viewed [jest.config.js](file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/jest.config.js) *

*Viewed [api-key.service.spec.ts](file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/modules/auth/services/api-key.service.spec.ts) *

*Viewed [auth.decorator.test.ts](file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/common/decorators/__tests__/auth.decorator.test.ts) *

### Planner Response

I'll create a new unit test file under `src/common/guards/__test__/` that follows the project's Jest patterns and covers positive, negative, and edge cases for [ApiKeyAuthGuard](cci:2://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/common/guards/api-key-auth.guard.ts:14:0-160:1).

*Edited relevant file*

### Planner Response

I'll run the test suite to ensure the new guard tests compile and pass alongside existing tests.

*User accepted the command `npm test --silent -- --runInBand`*

*User accepted the command `npm test --silent -- src/common/guards/__test__/api-key-auth.guard.spec.ts --runInBand`*

### Planner Response

I'll update the failing expectations in the newly added test file to correctly handle undefined values for the user-agent header in security event logging, then rerun the specific test file to confirm all cases pass.

*Edited relevant file*

*User accepted the command `npm test --silent -- src/common/guards/__test__/api-key-auth.guard.spec.ts --runInBand`*

### Planner Response

I created comprehensive unit tests for [ApiKeyAuthGuard](cci:2://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/common/guards/api-key-auth.guard.ts:14:0-160:1) that follow your repository’s testing patterns and Jest config.

What I added
- File: [src/common/guards/__test__/api-key-auth.guard.spec.ts](cci:7://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/common/guards/__test__/api-key-auth.guard.spec.ts:0:0-0:0)
- Style: Jest with Arrange-Act-Assert, descriptive names, self-contained mocks, and TypeScript typings.
- Location: Under `__test__` as requested.

Scenarios covered
- Positive (happy path)
  - When `SKIP_AUTH` is true, the guard allows access without validating the API key.
  - When a valid API key is provided and no permissions are required, the guard allows access and logs usage via `auditLogService.logActivity`.
  - When required permissions are satisfied, the guard allows access.
  - When wildcard permission `*` is present on the API key, the guard allows access.

- Negative (invalid inputs / error conditions)
  - When the API key is missing, the guard logs a security event and throws `UnauthorizedException`.
  - When the API key is invalid, the guard logs a security event and throws `UnauthorizedException`.
  - When required permissions are not satisfied, the guard logs a security event and throws `ForbiddenException`.
  - When an internal error occurs during validation, the guard logs a security event and throws a generic `UnauthorizedException`.

- Boundary / edge cases
  - Both `Authorization: Bearer` and `X-API-Key` headers provided → Authorization Bearer takes precedence.
  - User-Agent may be undefined in security event logs → expectations account for this.
  - IP detection covers multiple potential sources (x-forwarded-for, connection.remoteAddress, ip).

Implementation details
- Mocks:
  - `ApiKeyService.validateApiKey` mocked per test scenario.
  - `AuditLogService.logActivity` and [logSecurityEvent](cci:1://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/common/guards/api-key-auth.guard.ts:144:2-159:3) mocked to ensure calls are asserted with correct metadata.
  - `Reflector.getAllAndOverride` mocked to control `SKIP_AUTH` and `PERMISSIONS_KEY` metadata per test.
- ExecutionContext and Request are constructed manually to be self-contained and avoid a Nest test module setup for a small unit.

How to run just these tests
- Run the single spec:
  - npm test -- src/common/guards/__test__/api-key-auth.guard.spec.ts --runInBand

Notes
- The guard currently logs to console in [canActivate()](cci:1://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/common/guards/api-key-auth.guard.ts:22:2-116:3) (lines 63–65 of [src/common/guards/api-key-auth.guard.ts](cci:7://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/common/guards/api-key-auth.guard.ts:0:0-0:0)). These console logs appear during tests; if you’d like, I can remove them or guard them behind a NODE_ENV check to keep test output clean.

If you want me to add more edge cases or snapshot important arguments for log calls, I can extend the suite further.
