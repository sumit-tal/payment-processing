# Cascade Chat Conversation

  Note: _This is purely the output of the chat conversation and does not contain any raw data, codebase snippets, etc. used to generate the output._

### User Input

You are a senior software engineer. Write unit test cases for the following @[src/common/interceptors/audit.interceptor.ts] 

Requirements:
1. Follow existing written test cases.
2. write tests in __test__ folder
3. Cover positive scenarios (happy path).
4. Cover negative scenarios (invalid inputs, error conditions).
5. Include boundary/edge cases.
6. Use best practices for [framework] (e.g., Arrange-Act-Assert).
7. Make tests self-contained, readable, and maintainable.
8. Use clear and descriptive test names.


### Planner Response

To write accurate and aligned unit tests, I'll first open the interceptor file to understand its behavior and dependencies. I'll also scan the repository for any existing unit tests to match the project's testing style and configuration.

*Searched filesystem*

### Planner Response

I'll open the interceptor file to understand its logic and dependencies, and also glance at an existing test (e.g., the guard test under __test__) to match the project's testing style and folder structure.

*Viewed [audit.interceptor.ts](file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/common/interceptors/audit.interceptor.ts) *

### Planner Response

I'll open an existing test file to match the project's testing style, then create a new spec under `src/common/interceptors/__test__/` for [AuditInterceptor](cci:2://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/common/interceptors/audit.interceptor.ts:7:0-130:1).

*Viewed [api-key-auth.guard.spec.ts](file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/common/guards/__test__/api-key-auth.guard.spec.ts) *

### Planner Response

I'll create a new Jest spec file under `src/common/interceptors/__test__/` to cover the [AuditInterceptor](cci:2://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/common/interceptors/audit.interceptor.ts:7:0-130:1) positive, negative, and edge cases, following the existing project's testing style.

*Edited relevant file*

### Planner Response

I'll quickly check the project's test script and run the unit tests to ensure the new interceptor tests compile and pass, matching the existing Jest setup.

*Viewed [package.json](file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/package.json) *

*User accepted the command `npm test -- --runTestsByPath src/common/interceptors/__test__/audit.interceptor.spec.ts`*

### Planner Response

I'll fix a TypeScript typing issue in the new test by:
- Importing Observable from rxjs.
- Making the mockCallHandler generic so it accepts Observable<T> and returns CallHandler<T>.

Then I'll run the specific test to ensure it compiles and passes.

*Edited relevant file*

*Viewed [tsconfig.json](file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/tsconfig.json) *

*User accepted the command `npm test -- --runTestsByPath src/common/interceptors/__test__/audit.interceptor.spec.ts`*

# Summary of Changes
I added comprehensive unit tests for [AuditInterceptor](cci:2://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/common/interceptors/audit.interceptor.ts:7:0-130:1) in [src/common/interceptors/__test__/audit.interceptor.spec.ts](cci:7://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/common/interceptors/__test__/audit.interceptor.spec.ts:0:0-0:0), following the existing testing style and NestJS best practices (Arrange-Act-Assert). I ensured they are self-contained, readable, and maintainable, with clear and descriptive test names.

Key points:
- Tests are placed under `src/common/interceptors/__test__/` as requested.
- Follows existing test conventions seen in [src/common/guards/__test__/api-key-auth.guard.spec.ts](cci:7://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/common/guards/__test__/api-key-auth.guard.spec.ts:0:0-0:0).
- Uses path aliases (`@/...`) per [tsconfig.json](cci:7://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/tsconfig.json:0:0-0:0).
- Addressed TypeScript typing with a generic [mockCallHandler<T>()](cci:1://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/common/interceptors/__test__/audit.interceptor.spec.ts:56:0-58:3) to avoid inference issues.
- Verified by running the tests — they pass.

# Test Coverage
Positive (happy path):
- Logs a successful payment initiation with sanitized request body, correct entity type, metadata, duration, and user info.
- Maps correct actions for:
  - `POST /v1/subscriptions/cancel` → `SUBSCRIPTION_CANCELLED`
  - `PUT /v1/subscriptions/:id` → `SUBSCRIPTION_UPDATED`
- Webhook ingestion (`POST /v1/webhooks/...`) → `WEBHOOK_RECEIVED` attempts logging and doesn’t affect response flow.

Negative (error conditions):
- When the downstream handler throws, the interceptor logs a failed audit with the error message and correct duration, and rethrows.

Edge cases:
- No audit action mapping (e.g., `GET /v1/health`) → passes through without logging.
- IP resolution fallback order validated:
  - `x-forwarded-for` → `x-real-ip` → `connection.remoteAddress` → `req.ip` → `unknown`.
- Audit logging failure does not break the response flow (swallows logging error and continues).

# How to Run
- Run just these tests:
  - npm test -- --runTestsByPath src/common/interceptors/__test__/audit.interceptor.spec.ts
- Or run the entire suite:
  - npm test

If you want me to add more cases (e.g., additional payment routes like authorize/capture/void, or more sanitization edge cases), I can extend the suite similarly.
