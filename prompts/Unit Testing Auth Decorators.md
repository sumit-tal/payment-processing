Requirements:
1. Follow existing written test cases.
2. write tests in __test__ folder
3. Cover positive scenarios (happy path).
4. Cover negative scenarios (invalid inputs, error conditions).
5. Include boundary/edge cases.

### Planner Response

I have created comprehensive unit test cases for the [auth.decorator.ts](cci:7://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/common/decorators/auth.decorator.ts:0:0-0:0) file in the `__tests__` folder at [/Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI Native/payment-processing-system/src/common/decorators/__tests__/auth.decorator.test.ts](cci:7://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/payment-processing-system/src/common/decorators/__tests__/auth.decorator.test.ts:0:0-0:0). The tests follow Jest best practices, using Arrange-Act-Assert structure, and adhere to your naming conventions with "When" and "Then" in the test descriptions.

### Key Coverage:
- **RequirePermissions Decorator**: 
  - Positive scenarios: Single permission, multiple permissions.
  - Negative/Boundary: Empty permissions, duplicate permissions.
- **SkipAuth Decorator**: 
  - Positive scenario: Verifies metadata is set to skip auth.
- **Permissions Constants**: 
  - Positive: Verifies specific constants like `PAYMENTS_READ` and `ALL`.

The tests are self-contained, readable, and maintainable, with mocking for `@nestjs/common` to isolate the decorator logic. Each test checks if `SetMetadata` is called with the correct key and value.

To run the tests, you can use `npm test` or `jest` in your terminal. Let me know if you'd like any adjustments or additional tests!
