# PCI DSS Compliance Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) compliance measures implemented in the Payment Processing System. Our system follows SAQ A (Self-Assessment Questionnaire A) requirements as we do not store, process, or transmit cardholder data on our servers.

## Compliance Level: SAQ A

**SAQ A applies to merchants who:**
- Accept only card-not-present transactions
- All cardholder data functions are outsourced to PCI DSS validated third-party service providers
- Do not electronically store, process, or transmit any cardholder data on their systems or premises
- Have confirmed that all payment processing is handled entirely via PCI DSS validated payment processors

## Implementation Summary

### 1. No Cardholder Data Storage (Requirement 3)

**Implementation:**
- ✅ No sensitive authentication data is stored after authorization
- ✅ No cardholder data is stored in our database
- ✅ All payment processing is handled by Authorize.Net (PCI DSS Level 1 compliant)
- ✅ Only transaction references and metadata are stored

**Code Evidence:**
- Payment entities only store transaction IDs, amounts, and status
- No card number, CVV, or expiry date fields in database schema
- Sensitive data sanitization in audit logs

### 2. Secure Network and Systems (Requirements 1 & 2)

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Firewall configuration to protect cardholder data environment
- ✅ Default passwords and security parameters changed
- ✅ Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- ✅ Network segmentation where applicable

**Code Evidence:**
- Security configuration in `src/config/security.config.ts`
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Secure headers configuration

### 3. Protect Cardholder Data (Requirements 3 & 4)

**Implementation:**
- ✅ No cardholder data stored (N/A for storage requirements)
- ✅ Encryption of cardholder data transmission
- ✅ Strong cryptography and security protocols

**Code Evidence:**
- AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data
- HMAC signature validation for webhooks
- Crypto service with industry-standard algorithms

### 4. Vulnerability Management (Requirements 5 & 6)

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Anti-virus software (system level)
- ✅ Secure development processes
- ✅ Regular security updates
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization

**Code Evidence:**
- Comprehensive input validation with class-validator
- SQL injection prevention with TypeORM
- XSS protection with security headers

### 5. Access Control (Requirements 7 & 8)

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Restrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-know
- ✅ Unique ID assignment for each person with computer access
- ✅ Strong authentication and password policies

**Code Evidence:**
- API key authentication system
- Role-based permissions
- Account lockout mechanisms
- Password complexity requirements

### 6. Network Monitoring (Requirements 10 & 11)

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data
- ✅ Regular security testing
- ✅ Comprehensive audit logging

**Code Evidence:**
- Audit log service with comprehensive event tracking
- Security event monitoring
- Rate limiting and suspicious activity detection

### 7. Information Security Policy (Requirement 12)

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Information security policy maintained
- ✅ Security awareness program
- ✅ Incident response plan

## Security Features Implemented

### API Key Authentication
- Secure API key generation with cryptographic randomness
- bcrypt hashing for key storage
- Configurable permissions and rate limits
- Automatic key expiration and rotation support

### Rate Limiting
- Redis-based distributed rate limiting
- Configurable limits per API key
- IP-based fallback for unauthenticated requests
- Proper HTTP headers for rate limit status

### Audit Logging
- Comprehensive logging of all payment activities
- Secure log storage with data retention policies
- Real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities
- Sensitive data masking in logs

### Data Encryption
- AES-256-GCM for data at rest encryption
- HMAC-SHA256 for data integrity verification
- Secure key management and rotation
- TLS 1.2+ for data in transit

### PCI DSS Compliance Validation
- Automated compliance checking
- Real-time compliance scoring
- Detailed compliance reports
- Remediation recommendations

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Encryption
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-encryption-key-change-this-in-production
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_TTL=60
RATE_LIMIT_LIMIT=100

# Session Security
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret-change-this-in-production
SESSION_TIMEOUT=30

# PCI DSS
PCI_COMPLIANCE_MODE=true
DATA_RETENTION_DAYS=1095
AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS=365
```

### Security Headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block

## Compliance Validation

### Automated Checks
The system includes automated PCI DSS compliance validation:

```typescript
// Check compliance status
GET /security/compliance/check

// Generate compliance report
GET /security/compliance/report
```

### Manual Verification Steps

1. **Data Flow Analysis**
   - Verify no cardholder data enters our systems
   - Confirm all payment processing via Authorize.Net
   - Validate data sanitization in logs

2. **Network Security**
   - Verify TLS configuration
   - Check firewall rules
   - Validate network segmentation

3. **Access Controls**
   - Review API key permissions
   - Verify authentication mechanisms
   - Check audit trail completeness

4. **Code Review**
   - Static analysis for security vulnerabilities
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Secure coding practices verification

## Incident Response

### Security Event Detection
- Failed authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Suspicious API usage patterns
- System anomalies

### Response Procedures
1. Immediate containment
2. Impact assessment
3. Evidence preservation
4. Notification procedures
5. Recovery and lessons learned

## Compliance Maintenance

### Regular Activities
