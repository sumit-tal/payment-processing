# Payment Processing System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a robust backend application that handles payment integration with the Authorize.Net Sandbox API. The vision is to enable developers to work on payment gateway integration, a common task across many domains, while utilizing AI tools to overcome associated challenges. The service must support both core and advanced payment flows, ensuring reliability, scalability, and compliance.

## Objectives

- Provide a comprehensive payment processing backend.
- Support essential payment operations including purchases, refunds, cancellations, and authorizations.
- Enable advanced features like recurring billing, idempotent retries, and asynchronous webhook handling.
- Implement distributed tracing for end-to-end request tracking.
- Ensure scalability through queue-based event handling.
- Adhere to compliance standards such as PCI DSS.

## Functional Requirements

The system must implement the following core payment flows against the Authorize.Net Sandbox API:

1. **Purchase (Auth + Capture in One Step)**: Process a single-step transaction where authorization and capture occur simultaneously.

2. **Authorize + Capture (Two-Step)**: Handle separate authorization and capture steps, allowing for delayed capture.

3. **Cancel (Before Capture)**: Void an authorized transaction before it is captured.

4. **Refunds (Full + Partial)**: Support full and partial refunds for completed transactions.

5. **Subscriptions / Recurring Billing**: Set up and manage recurring payments, such as monthly subscription plans.

6. **Idempotency & Retries**: Ensure safe retry mechanisms for requests, handling duplicates (e.g., duplicate webhook events or failed capture retries).

7. **Webhooks**: Implement handlers for asynchronous payment events, including payment success, failure, and refund completion notifications.

8. **Distributed Tracing**: Include correlation IDs in every request and response; logs must enable end-to-end tracing of payment flows.

9. **Scalability Considerations**: Use queue-based handling for webhooks and events, supporting in-memory queues or external message brokers.

10. **Compliance Considerations**: Document and implement PCI DSS handling, secure secrets management, rate limiting, and audit logging.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Technical Constraints & Rules

- **Integration**: Must integrate directly with the Authorize.Net Sandbox API without third-party wrappers. Use official SDKs if available for the chosen language.

- **Technology Stack**: Language and stack of choice (e.g., Java, Python, JS/TS, C#, Go), but must align with best practices for the selected technology.

- **Testing**: Support unit testing with at least 80% code coverage.

- **Tracing**: Implement distributed tracing with correlation IDs in logs and a metrics endpoint.

### Security & Compliance

- Follow PCI DSS guidelines for handling sensitive payment data.
- Implement secure secrets management for API keys and credentials.
- Apply rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- Maintain audit logs for all payment-related activities.

### Performance & Scalability

- Handle high volumes of transactions efficiently.
- Use asynchronous processing for webhooks to avoid blocking operations.
- Support horizontal scaling through queue-based architectures.

## Success Criteria

- All core and advanced payment flows function correctly in the sandbox environment.
- System achieves >80% unit test coverage.
- End-to-end tracing is verifiable through logs and metrics.
- Webhook events are processed asynchronously without data loss.
- Compliance documentation is complete and aligned with PCI DSS requirements.
