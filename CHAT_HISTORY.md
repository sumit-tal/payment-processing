# Overview

The design process for the payment processing system was conducted through a structured collaboration with an AI assistant, following a prompt-driven approach that emphasized architectural best practices, systematic evaluation of industry standards, and continuous feedback. Every major design and implementation milestone was reviewed, justified, and iteratively improved based on AI suggestions and alternative comparisons.

## Early Decision Points

- Architecture Style: AI guided a discussion weighing monolithic vs. microservices, with an explicit preference documented for a monolithic NestJS/TypeScript design for maintainability and simplicity given project requirements.
- API Style & Technology Choices: REST APIs and PostgreSQL (via TypeORM) were selected after the AI outlined various database and API paradigms, comparing their trade-offs for fintech workflows.
- External Integration: Integration with Authorize.Net and AWS SQS was planned. The AI requested exhaustive endpoint, error-handling, and rate-limiting preferences, ensuring alignment with compliance and scalability needs.

## Exploring and Evaluating Alternatives

During requirements breakdown, the AI repeatedly prompted about scaling, testability, observability, and DevOps practices, clarifying pain points or gaps before recommending an approach.

For task implementation (e.g., webhook/async processing, security/compliance), the AI suggested industry-standard workflows—comparing cryptographic practices, rate-limiting methods, and validation schemes—ensuring each step could be easily explained or justified against alternatives.

The choice of idempotency and retry strategies for webhook delivery was presented with multiple architectural means (deduplicated processing vs. DB constraints), and the AI simulated the impact of each, then helped select a multi-layer duplicate prevention mechanism.

## Major Implementation Milestones

### Webhook and Asynchronous Processing

When implementing webhook and async infrastructure, the AI mapped out stepwise solutions: SQS integration, dead-letter queues, idempotency, and type-safe DTOs.

Security choices (such as HMAC-based request validation) were benchmarked, and AI explained the relative pros/cons before code generation.

The design included observability hooks and robust error handling, suggested and reviewed by the AI in light of common industry outages.

### Security and Compliance

For API key auth, rate limiting, and PCI DSS compliance, AI prompted about expiration, key rotation, encryption strengths, storage patterns, and API access granularity.

AI offered a pros/cons list for each compliance step (e.g., rate-limiting mechanisms: middleware design, Redis integration, configuration patterns for future growth) before implementation.

The audit logging, error masking, and reporting features were planned and justified against real-world compliance needs, resulting in a solution that met both technical and regulatory requirements.

## Summary of AI-Driven Practices

- **Design Exploration**: Each technical direction was pressure-tested by the AI for scalability, reliability, and maintainability. Alternatives were described, compared, and optimized interactively.

- **Prompt Contextualization**: The AI maintained full context from previous design threads, minimizing redundancy and surfacing crucial open questions for discussion at each key milestone.

- **Documentation and Traceability**: All significant decisions and trade-offs, as well as the rationale for final selections, were recorded in code, configuration, and architectural documentation drafts produced throughout the project.
