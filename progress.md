## Notes and Decisions

### Technical Decisions Made:
- **Database**: PostgreSQL chosen for ACID compliance and JSON support
- **Payment Gateway**: Authorize.Net for both one-time and recurring payments
- **Architecture**: Modular NestJS structure with clear separation of concerns
- **Testing**: Jest with comprehensive mocking for external dependencies
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation
- **Security**: PCI DSS compliant approach with no sensitive data storage
- **Authentication**: API key-based authentication with role-based permissions
- **Rate Limiting**: Redis-backed distributed rate limiting for API protection
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for all payment and security activities
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data with secure key management
- **Compliance**: Automated PCI DSS compliance validation and reporting
- **Async Processing**: AWS SQS for reliable webhook event processing
- **Idempotency**: Multi-layer approach using external IDs and content hashing
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and error tracking for webhook processing
- **Observability**: Distributed tracing with correlation IDs and structured logging
- **Metrics**: Prometheus integration for system performance monitoring
- **Logging**: PCI-compliant structured logging with sensitive data masking
